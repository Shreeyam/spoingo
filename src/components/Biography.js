            Hey, I’m Shreeyam. I am a PhD candidate at MIT's Space Telecommunications, Astronomy and Radiation Laboratory with PI Prof. Kerri Cahoy. I work on autonomous systems, instrumentation, and machine learning applied to spacecraft. Currently I work on dynamic tasking formulations for Earth-observing satellites
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I thrive at the cutting edge of technology, whether it’s optimizing spacecraft imaging schedules, testing machine learning algorithms in orbit, or developing new hardware for autonomous systems. Along the way, I’ve worked on free-space optical communications at Google [X], built flight electronics for rocketry teams, and published research on reinforcement-learned heuristics for satellite tasking.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Outside of research, I enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges, automating anything that can be automated, and blending AI with aerospace in ways that push the limits of what’s possible. Always up for a discussion on spacecraft autonomy, deep learning, or the quirks of embedded computing!
